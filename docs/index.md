# Athena Dotnet Client Library Documentation

This is the documentation for the Athena Dotnet Client Library.

For a broad overview of the Athena API, see the
[Introduction](docs/introduction.md) page.

View the API Reference for detailed information on the available classes and
methods, the [AthenaClient](xref:Resolver.Athena.AthenaClient) class is a good
place to start.

To get an example of how to use the Athena Dotnet Client Library, see the
`Resolver.Athena.CliClient` example project
[here](https://github.com/crispthinking/athena-dotnet-client/blob/main/examples/Resolver.Athena.CliClient/Program.cs).
The `DoCommand` methods in the `Program.cs` file demonstrate how to setup and
use the various clients and methods available in the library. This example
project also acts as a simple command line interface to the Athena API,
allowing you to classify images from the command line in order to perform quick
tests.
